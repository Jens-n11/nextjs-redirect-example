## Demo of redirect shows white page if done in page.tsx

I would expect that the NextLink would redirect directly to the new page if a linked page.tsx file throws a redirect. Instead it renders a white page for a short time before it redirects.

Expected behaviour (like it is for example with a normal <a> tag) vs actual behaviour with the NextLink component in the video below:
